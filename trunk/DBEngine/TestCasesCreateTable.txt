Test Cases for Table Creation

Check table name already exists.... If so flag an error else create table
Check for duplicate column name and type combination......
	Same name and different data types are correct
	Same name and same data types are not correct.....
Check whether key is present or not for the table.
Check whether key is single column or multi-column.
Check whether key was specified inline or separately.
Check whether any field is auto-generated.
	Decide on start value and step size.
	Decide what to do if data type is char or varchar. - My thinking do not allow auto generation for char or varchar
	Decide for float/double. - Same logic as above.
	So mostly on int.......
Check whether any field has default values.
Check whether default values fall inside the limits of the data types.

Check with Chinmay if we are allowing tables to be created without columns specified. Columns can be specified with alter
query later. If this then, in the query field, there should be no. of coulmns 0.
